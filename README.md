### Overview

This is a Trivia Game made up of nonsense questions and answers.  It might not make any sense but there are correct answers.  The questions and answers are shuffled so memorizing the placement of the answers will not help.  

Written using ReactJS, Bootstrap, and CSS grid.  Bootstrap was just used to help quickly create each of the components.  CSS grid was just used to help layout certain parts of the app.
